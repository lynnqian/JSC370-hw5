### Conclusion

In conclusion, we do see that:

1. apps in the categories of `Communication` and `Social` are more popular than other types of apps, and have a relatively stable rating. apps like `Game` and `Tools` are only targeting specific group of people, thus are less popular but has higher rating due to their usage and entertainment characteristics.  

2. all the most popular apps are small in size, and apps in the type of `Game` and `Family` are larger than other types. Other than that, we don't see any relationship between size of the app and ratings.

3. number of installs of the apps can be used to indicate popularity, just like we used number of reviews for previous analysis.
