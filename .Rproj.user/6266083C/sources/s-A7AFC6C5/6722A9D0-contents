This is my JSC370 Homework 5 project page!

The three navigation bars on top leads to: analyzing and visualizations, conclusion, and my github page.

<br> 
I will be using my google-playstore data from midterm project.

The variables we are interested in:

- `Rating`: the rating of the app. We want to find all the factors affecting the rating.
- `Reviews`: the number of reviews of the app. Could indicate the popularity of the app.
- `Category`: the category of the app. Examples are: `art and design`, `Game`, `Tools`, etc.
- `Size`: the size of the app. This is a new variable compared with my midterm project, and we will discuss about it below.
- `Installs`: number of installs of the app.
